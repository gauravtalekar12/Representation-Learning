# Representation-Learning
Advanced deep representation learning aims to create a hierarchy of features or representations. Deep neural networks consist of multiple layers, where each layer extracts increasingly abstract and meaningful features from the input data. This hierarchy allows for better understanding and generalization of complex patterns.
